# make

I think this is the simplest makefile ever created.
It's inspired by ubasic project by adamdunkels https://github.com/adamdunkels/ubasic/blob/master/Makefile

You need to export CC=gcc if CC is not defined on MinGW64. It can be done in $home/.bash_profile.

You don't need to export anything on Ubuntu 16.04 since cc has been defined to gcc already.
